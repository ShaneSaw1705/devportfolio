            <h3>Hello!,</h3>
            My name is Sinan and I specialize in web developement that utilizes
            HTML, CSS, JS, and REACT etc. I am a highly motivated individual and
            eternal optimist dedicated to writing clear, concise, robust code
            that works. Striving to never stop learning and improving. When I'm
            not coding, I am writing bolgs, reading, or picking up some new
            hands-on art project like photography. I like to have my perspective
            and belief systems challenged so that I see the world through new
            eyes.
