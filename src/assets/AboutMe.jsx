                My name is Shane and I specialize in web developement that
                utilizes <span>HTML, CSS, JS,</span> and <span>REACT</span> etc.
                I am a highly motivated individual and eternal optimist
                dedicated to writing clear, concise, robust code that works.
                Striving to never stop learning and improving. When I'm not
                coding, I am writing bolgs, reading, or picking up some new
                hands-on art project like photography. I like to have my
                perspective and belief systems challenged so that I see the
                world through new eyes.
